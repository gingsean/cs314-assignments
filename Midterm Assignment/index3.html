  			<br>
  			<p> Being an Eagle Scout I have gained a passion for both car camping and backpacking.  I have been to several campgrounds all across the Pacific Northwest and have also had the opportunity to go on a two week backpacking trip in New Mexico. </p>

  			<h6> Hiking </h6>
  			<br>
  			<p> Growing up in the Pacific Northwest has given me the opportunity to do a wide collection of hikes.  I love to find new hikes with my friends and explore mountains in order to find amazing views, lakes, and waterfalls. </p>

  			<br>
  			<p> I was a swimmer in highschool and have always loved taking advantage of practicing in natural bodies of water.  Boating, with my best friends, on Lake Washington has been how I have spent a lot of freetime in my summers as well. </p>

  		<h6> Gonzaga University Specialized Recreation </h6>
  		<br>
  		<p>  I am one of the coordinators for a program at Gonzaga University that is called Gonzaga University Specialized Recreation (GUSR).  We create an inclusive environment that involves college students and adults with disabilities.  There are two separate parts to our program.  The first part is sports where we do bowling with the Special Olympics in the Fall and play Basketball in the Spring.  For the second part of our program we put on a play performance for the Spokane community at the end of each semester. </p>
